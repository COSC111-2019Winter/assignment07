[summary of the inclass assignment]

The first two phases of the inclass assignment is the same as the previous inclass assignment.

#### phase 1. obtain the java files from the repository
1. download the java files from the repository
   
   find your downloaded .zip file (**If it's in the lab machine, it should be in the ```downloads``` folder**)

2. right-click (in Mac, maybe ctrl-leftclick), and you will see unzip option (or ```uncompress``` option or ```extract all...```), click that option, and uncompress the ```assignment07-master.zip``` file.

3. after you uncompress the zip file, there should be a folder with all the java files. The folder name should be ```assignment07-master```.


#### phase 2. set up BlueJ project
4. create a BlueJ project; you can give any name to your project; and know where the project is in your file system, that is the actual folder in Windows/Mac (we did it in the last assignment).

5. in the BlueJ project window, close the project (by clicking the Project button in the menu bar and "close") and then **close** the BlueJ window

6. go to your folder (file system), find the folder that have all the java files (we did it in step 3), and copy the java files to the BlueJ project folder in your file system (not in BlueJ)

7. open BlueJ project again, and open the project if it's not opened (by clicking Project button in the menu and "open project", then find your BlueJ project folder, "click select folder"), you should see the new classes you just added.

#### phase 3. [todo]
8. inside the main method in Main class, use **one** ```System.out.print``` (not ```System.out.println```) to print the following text:

#### phase 4. upload the new ```.java``` files (keep the original filenames; do not change the filenames)

**ignore the .class files, we only need .java files**

That's it!

### Grading
Each class (.java) worths 0.25 points. In total, it's 1.0 points.
If the format of ```.java``` file is different from the **auto-indent format** BlueJ producdes, the ```.java``` file will be rejected as a submission (i.e., point 0 unless you resubmit and will suffer late penalty.)

* convention 1: when a variable name contains more than one word, like firstName, capitalize the first letter of each word except the first.
